# Culture

Culture is an abstract yield that broadly determines, alongside military might, the degree of control one has over one's civilisation.

Each civilisation has culture points that can influence cities. Citizens you control will produce culture points from your civilisation. Culture points also spread through trade and migration.

### Consumption

Every turn, a citizen in a city should either be under military control, or consume one culture point of your civilisation from the city. Otherwise, that citizen will not be considered under your control. 

When consuming culture, citizens consume culture in proportion to how much is there. For example, if Civilisation A has 10 culture and Civilisation B has 5 culture and the city has 3 citizens, then 2 citizens will consume culture from Civilisation A, and 1 citizen will consume culture from Civilisation B. 

A citizen that is from a different culture from the city owner's and not kept in check by military police:
 - Will not allocate Commerce to Military or the Treasury;
 - Will produce culture of a type not from the city owner;
 - Will be unhappy if the Cultural Institutions are different between the city owner and the culture they come from, reducing overall appeal and increasing the chance of a revolt.

Having multiple cultures can also be beneficial:
 - Cities that have more similar cultures are more likely to trade with one another.
 - Civilisations that have cultural similarity between their cities naturally have stronger diplomatic relations.

Having a high total culture also boosts appeal, and sourcing culture from other civilisations may be easier than generating culture entirely locally. 

### Military Police

Having the military regulate citizens who are not under cultural control is often necessary, but also comes with its own risks. 

Each soldier, depending on its strength, contributes a certain maximum amount of control over citizens. 

For each control that is actively used, the appeal of the city is reduced. Citizens that are controlled by the military are also made unhappy. 

### Cultural Institutions

Cultural institutions are common ways of living life, including through language, writing systems, religion, and fashion. Which cultural institutions your civilisation adopts determines how your civilisation is able to interact with others. 

Having shared cultural institutions between two civilisations boosts trade between them. It also makes the culture of the cultural institution's originator more influential.
