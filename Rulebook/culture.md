# Culture

Culture is an abstract yield that broadly determines, alongside military might, the degree of control one has over one's civilisation.

Each civilisation has culture points that can influence cities. Citizens you control will produce culture points from your civilisation. Culture points also spread through trade and migration.

### Production

Culture comes in two main divisions:
- Civilisation culture: the culture type that is the main culture of one's civilisation
- Local city culture: a culture type that is unique to each city

The city center and each citizen in a city will produce 1 local city culture per turn. In practice, this will mean that citizens are always able to consume culture.

The local city culture of a civilisation's capital city is that civilisation's culture. A civilisation's culture is also produced by all culture production in cities ruled by that civilisation.

Culture is produced by citizens working on culture, and cultural buildings. 

### Consumption

Every turn, a citizen in a city should either be under military control, or consume one culture point of your civilisation from the city. Otherwise, that citizen will not be considered under your control. 

When consuming culture, citizens consume culture in proportion to how much is there. For example, if Civilisation A has 10 culture and Civilisation B has 5 culture and the city has 3 citizens, then 2 citizens will consume culture from Civilisation A, and 1 citizen will consume culture from Civilisation B. 

A citizen that is from a different culture from the city owner's and not kept in check by military police:
 - Will allocate less Commerce to Military or the Treasury;
 - Will be unhappy, reducing overall appeal and increasing the chance of a revolt.

The degree to which these penalties apply is based on how different the two cultures' institutions are. See more in the Cultural Institutions section below.

Having multiple cultures can also be beneficial:
 - Cities that have more similar cultures, on average, are more likely to trade with one another.
 - Civilisations that have cultural similarity between their cities naturally have stronger diplomatic relations.

Having a high total culture also boosts appeal, and sourcing culture from other civilisations may be easier than generating culture entirely locally. 

### Military Police

Having the military regulate citizens who are not under cultural control is often necessary, but also comes with its own risks. 

Each soldier, depending on its strength, contributes a certain maximum amount of control over citizens. 

For each control that is actively used, the appeal of the city is reduced. Citizens that are controlled by the military are also made unhappy. 

### Cultural Institutions

Cultural institutions are common ways of living life, including through language, writing systems, religion, and fashion. Which cultural institutions your civilisation adopts determines how your civilisation is able to interact with others. 

Having shared cultural institutions between two civilisations boosts trade between them. It also makes the culture of the cultural institution's originator more influential.

Adopting the cultural institutions of another civilisation is beneficial if that civilisation's culture is prominent in your cities, or otherwise if their institution is widespread and would benefit your trade. 

In your cities, the degree to which other cultures causes penalties is based on how many cultural institutions differ between them. Before a culture adopts a certain institution, that institution is considered to differ from all others. 

Two distinct cultures are never 100% the same and will always have some differences. The effect is the same as though there is another institution, "culture type", which cannot be changed and is always different between different cultures. 

Local city culture is considered to have the same institutions as the city owner, but has a different culture type. Early in the game, this means that local city culture gaining on your civilisation's culture will penalise the city more harshly, while later in the game this effect becomes less pronounced. 

More institutions are unlocked with technology, with each allowing for more congruity with others. The institutions are:

- Prestige Language (N/A)
- Writing System (Writing)
- Currency (Currency)
- Religion (Theology)
- Lingua Franca (???)
- Fashion (Industrialisation)
- Nationality* (Nationalism)

Some of these institutions might differ in their functionality. For example, nationalist movements might lead to other Nationalities being adopted in local city culture that is different from the city owner's. Currency might only affect trade relations and have no effect on cultural similarity for other considerations.
