# Culture

Culture is an abstract yield that works to provide manifold benefits to a civilisation.

Culture has two main realisations in the game:
 - Control of territory;
 - Cultural influence and institutions.

### Cultural Institutions

Cultural institutions are common ways of living life, including through language, writing systems, religion, and fashion. Which cultural institutions your civilisation adopts determines how your civilisation is able to interact with others. 

Having shared cultural institutions between two civilisations boosts trade between them. It also makes the culture of the cultural institution's originator more influential.
