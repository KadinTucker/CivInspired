# Resources

There are two types of resources: 
 - *Yields* are fundamental resources that your civilisation consumes to make new things.
 - *Goods* are tangible items that appear in the world and can occasionally be produced, and that can be traded. 

### Yields

There are six yields:
 - *Food*: necessary for citizens to survive, it is consumed regularly by all population units.
 - *Materials*: consumed by citizens to create *production*, another yield. 
 - *Production*: created by citizens using the help of materials and allows for building city improvements as well as being converted into other yields.
 - *Commerce*: represents the abstract ability of people to move things around. Commerce facilitates trade and can also be converted inefficiently to other yields.
 - *Science*: representing knowledge, science is used to unlock new technologies for a civilization.
 - *Culture*: an abstract yield representing the appeal and influence of a particular civilisation's culture, which can be used to expand borders, promote national unity, and influence other civilizations. 

Some yields can move between cities, while others cannot. Some yields also improve the appeal* of a city, causing that city to grow. 

| Yield      | Transferable | Improves Appeal |
|------------|--------------|-----------------|
| Food       | Yes          | Yes             |
| Materials  | Yes          | Yes             |
| Production | No           | No              |
| Commerce   | Special      | No              |
| Science    | No           | No              |
| Culture    | No           | Yes             |

### Goods

Goods are specific resources that indirectly contribute to yields. 

Goods are found as resources in the world on individual tiles. Where a good appears can depend on:
 - The continent on which it is found;
 - Whether a related good can be found nearby;
 - The climate/terrain type;
 - Placement ("planting") of goods by a player.

There are X classes of goods with different functions, appearance rates, and uses, summarised in the table below.

| Class of Good | Function                                       | Diversity helps? | Examples                                                     | Appearance                                            | Replantable                     |
|---------------|------------------------------------------------|------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------|---------------------------------|
| Foodstuffs    | Produces food for a city                       | Yes              | Wheat, Rice, Maize, Potatoes, Sorghum, Bananas, Cassava      | Restricted by continent                               | Yes                             |
| Livestock     | Provides food and commerce                     | Yes              | Cattle, Sheep, Buffalo, Bison, Llama, Deer                   | Restricted by continent                               | Yes                             |
| Material      | Provides materials and improves military units | Sometimes        | Lumber, Tropical Wood, Stone, Iron, Nitre, Rubber, Aluminium | Typically restricted to hostile terrain               | No                              |
| Luxury        | Improve the appeal of cities that consume them | Yes              | Spices, Wine, Salt, Silk, Sugar, Gems, Ivory, etc.           | Appear in clusters, sometimes restricted by continent | Only if restricted by continent |
| Energy        | Provides energy* to cities and military units  | No               | Horses, Coal, Oil, Methane, Uranium                          | Typically restricted to hostile terrain               | No, except Horses               |
| Synthetic     | Varies                                         | Varies           | Plastics, Consumer Goods, Pharmaceuticals, Electricity*      | Nowhere; created by cities themselves                 | N/A                             |

*: Electricity is a unique good in that it provides energy, but is synthetic. 

All goods are transferable, in that they can move between cities through trade*. Having a diversity of goods tends to be best for a city and provides benefits to appeal and potentially to any yields the goods provide.
