# Technology

Technology is acquired by a civilisation using Science*, and allows for more advanced ways to use resources*, as well as more efficient ways to use those resources.

### Research

Research is done through producing Science*. Science is produced though:
 - Philosophical and Scientific specialists*;
 - Trade with more technologically advanced civilisations;
 - Allocation of Commerce* or Production*. 

At the game start, only the last option is available, but with more technologies and access to the world come more abilities to produce Science.

#### Discovery and Adoption

A technology has two fundamental costs: *discovery*, being the cost of coming up with the technology at all; and *adoption*, being the cost of enough people in the civilisation learning about the technology to actually use it. 

The cost of discovery is unique to the technology, and is typically expensive. 

The cost of adoption is based on the total number of cities plus the population of the civilisation adopting it, and also scales with the era. This represents the cost of everyone in the civilisation learning about the technology, and a select group of people mastering it. 

The effect of the cost of adoption is that larger empires need to produce more science to actually have technologies readily available. This is akin to nuclear fission being discovered many years before nuclear weapons and power are actually able to be implemented.

Points are first allocated to discoveries. If a civilisation discovers a technology, then it is recorded that this civilisation has, independently, discovered this technology. Science points are then allocated to adoption.

#### Trade

When civilisations trade, science points are also exchanged. These science points are specific to a technology, and are contributed to both the discovery and adoption costs of the technology. 

These points are also specific to the civilisation that discovered the technology. If a civilisation would discover a technology using science from another civilisation's discovery, then the civilisation that originally made the discovery is recorded as such, and scores points. 

### Eras

There are eight distinct eras in the game: Ancient, Classical, Medieval, Industrial, Modern, Atomic, and Information. Different civilisations might be in different eras at the same time.
