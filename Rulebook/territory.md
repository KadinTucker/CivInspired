# Territory

A player's territory consists of tiles that are, in one way or another, controlled by that player. Territory can have varying degrees of control, from least to greatest:
- Claimed: the territory has been explored and claimed by the player, but there is nothing other than this claim that concretely makes it their territory.
- Ruled: the territory is claimed by the player and that claim is backed up by an established military presence. 
- Core: the territory is populated and used by people loyal to that player near one of the player's cities.

Territory may be contested between multiple players. This can happen if:
- Two or more players lay a Claim to a territory.
- One or more players Claim a territory that is Ruled or a Core of another player.
- A player Rules a territory that is a Core territory of another player, i.e. during wartime. 

In particular, each territory can be the Core of at most one player (and must be associated to exactly one City), and each territory can be Ruled by at most one player. The players Ruling a territory and having that territory as a Core may be different. Multiple players may Claim a single territory.
